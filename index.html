    <h1>Importance of Blood Donation</h1>
    <p>


        Blood donation is a voluntary practice that helps those in need of blood transfusion due to some accident or
        illness. The most essential body fluid, excessive blood loss can cause an untimely death if the need is not
        fulfilled immediately. Hence, blood donation is a life-saving procedure.

        <strong style="color: red;">14th June </strong>is observed worldwide, as World Blood Donor Day to raise awareness
        among people regarding the requirement for safe blood as well as blood products like whole blood. A campaign of
        WHO, this day is also marked by the heart-warming gesture of thanking each donor.</p>


    <h1>Benefits of Blood Donation: Why You Should Donate Blood</h1>
    <p>


        There may be different reasons behind the blood requirement of an ill person. Maybe he has met with an accident,
        has undergone an operation or is suffering from an illness like anemia. Your donated blood goes on to help this
        affected person in overcoming his critical situation and regain new life. It symbolizes a helpful and
        responsible gesture not only to the person in need, but also towards society at large.</p>
    <h4 style="color: black;">Advantageous for the Body</h4>
    <p>Blood donation is not at all harmful for the body; rather the four or five liters of blood that can be donated
        every three or four months by both men and women ensures that you remain fit and fine. Firstly, the cell
        depletion that occurs due to blood donation, forces the body to produce new cells within 48 hours, thereby
        freshening up the entire body system. Secondly, the body is armed against a host of diseases ranging from liver
        and heart problems to even cancer. Thirdly, within just one or two months, a donor regains his lost blood. Thus,
        donating blood is in another way, a step towards revitalizing your body.</p>
    <h4 style="color: black;">Blood Donation is the Sole Way of Obtaining Blood</h4>
    <p>Blood can neither be artificially produced nor can it be stored beyond a definite time. Amidst the three
        components of blood, plasma can be preserved for years, red blood cells can be stored for 42 days and platelets
        can be kept only for 5 days. Consequently, the rush for blood is always on the high in hospitals and the only
        way to meet this requirement is through donation.</p>
    <h4 style="color: black;">One Donation Fulfils Three Different Requisites</h4>
    <p>Since three different components are provided by a single donation, three different people may be helped by it.
        Considering the millions of people needing blood every year, imagine how each donation is, therefore, precious.
